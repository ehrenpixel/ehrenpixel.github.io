# Games with Principles

Ehrenpixel is an indie game studio built on a simple belief: **games should honor the people who play them.**

We’re not here to sell your data, flood your screen with ads, or hide fun behind paywalls. No pay-to-win. No tricks. No nonsense. Just honest, handcrafted games — driven by passion, not profit traps.

We create the games we’d love to play ourselves: experiences that respect your time, protect your privacy, and challenge your mind.

Our community is our heartbeat. We listen, update, and improve — because great games aren’t transactions, they’re conversations.

Every pixel we place, every line of code we write, is guided by one principle:

**Honor the player. Respect the game.**

Join us, share your voice, and enjoy games made with care.  
_Crafted in Germany. Played with joy. That’s Ehrenpixel._
