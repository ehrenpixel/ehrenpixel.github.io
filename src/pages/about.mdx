# Games with principles

We’re Ehrenpixel — an indie game studio born from the simple idea that games should respect the people who play them.

We’re not here to sell your data, flood your screen with ads, or lock fun behind a paywall.
No pay-to-win. No tricks. No nonsense. Just games — honest, handcrafted, and driven by passion.

We’re gamers first. Developers second.
We build what we’d want to play: games that respect your time, your privacy, and your intelligence.

Our community matters. We listen. We update. We improve.
Because making great games isn’t a transaction — it’s a dialogue.

Every pixel we place, every line of code we write, is guided by a simple principle:\
**Honor the player. Respect the game.**

Crafted in Germany. Made with care. Played with joy.
That’s Ehrenpixel.
