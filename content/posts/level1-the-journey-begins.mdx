## 🎉 Welcome to Ehrenpixel

Hey there and welcome to the very first post on the Ehrenpixel blog!

We’re a small team of gamers, dreamers and developers on a mission to create the kind of studio and games that we’ve always wanted to see in the world. For us, this isn’t just a website launch; it’s the beginning of something we’ve been thinking (and talking) about for decades. And now it's real! It's exciting, and a little nerve-wracking too!

## 🎮 Why Ehrenpixel?

We’re gamers first, developers second.

We believe games should respect your time, your privacy, and your intelligence. That means:

- No ads  
- No pay-to-win  
- No gimmicks  
- Just honest, handcrafted fun—built with care and played with joy.

This is what "games with principles" means to us.

## 🚀 What’s Next: *Tiltsprint*

Our debut title, **Tiltsprint**, is already in the works!

It’s a fast-paced mobile game where you race by tilting your phone - easy to learn, tough to master, and perfect for bite-sized competition. Whether you're commuting, chilling, or procrastinating, it’s designed to deliver pure gameplay with no strings attached.

Want to help shape it?

## 🛠️ The Road Ahead

This is just the beginning.

We’re building more than games—we’re building a community. Expect devlogs, behind-the-scenes updates, and chances to get involved. Your feedback will guide every pixel we place and every feature we ship.

Thanks for being here at the start of our journey. If you’ve got thoughts, ideas, or just want to say hi - we’d love to hear from you.

**Let’s build something great. Let’s play.**
