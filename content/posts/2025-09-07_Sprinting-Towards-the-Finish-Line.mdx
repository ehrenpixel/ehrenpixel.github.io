Hey everyone,

We're incredibly excited to share some major progress on our first game, Tiltsprint! The last few weeks have been a whirlwind of development, and we're thrilled to be well ahead of schedule on our internal alpha milestone.

## So, what have we been up to?

Our focus has been on building out the core game experience. We've tackled some pesky bugs and rolled out a ton of great new features:

- **Levels & Highscrores:** Our lead playtester, Nils, has created his first level for development purposes, and he has even beaten all the high scores! He's a tough one to beat! But don't worry — we've added an internal high score to each level, so you can track your progress and see when you've beaten your personal best. The public and official leaderboards will be included in our next releases.
- **Seamless Gameplay:** We’ve implemented a solid restart and next-level logic, making the game flow smoothly from one challenge to the next.
- **Quality of Life:** We’ve added a handy hot-reload button to the top right of the screen. This small change has made a huge difference to our development process and helped Nils beat his own scores.

## Behind the Scenes

On the studio side, we've been busy behind the scenes streamlining our workflow. We've migrated our project management and documents to new platforms, which has given us a huge boost in productivity.

This progress is bringing us closer to a public release, and we can’t wait to get Tiltsprint into your hands. As always, your feedback is what drives us, and we're looking forward to sharing more updates as we continue this journey together.

Thanks for following along!
